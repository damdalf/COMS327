I have elected to keep the README from the most recent assignment,
but to run this game you will need to unzip the CSV folder and 
move the corresponding folder to this location within your HOME
directory:

/Users/yourName/.poke327/pokedex/data/csv 

From there, navigate back to this directory and run 'make'.
From there, run the program like you would with any C / C++ program
with './poke327'.

ASSIGNMENT 1.08:

*** NOTE ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I simply created a folder of the needed DB files following Sheaffer's path from
his 1.07 solution. If you must change the path, please see lines 48 - 64.

For this assignment we were tasked with implementing several different 
functionalities, including: a bag / inventory for the PC (which can be accessed
using 'B'), the ability to view the PC's Pokemon (which can be displayed using
'p'),  wild Pokemon battles, and Trainer Battles. We also had to include 
the following items which are stored within the PC's bag, which can be used:
Revives, Potions, and Pokeballs.

While there is far more that can be said about all of the finer details (such 
as calculating the odds of a PC's escape from a wild Pokemon, whether a 
Pokemon's move hit or missed, the damage done by a Pokemon's move, etc.). 
However, I have put in a ton of time into this assignment and for once I am 
electing to keep my README short and straight forward. 

I have met all of the requirements listed in the assignment's PDF, and there are 
no bugs that I am aware of. I have tested the code quite extensively, so please
inform me if you are able to find a bug that I did not detect. While there are
several features that I believe I implemented very creatively / efficiently, the 
only major one that comes to mind is how I went about implementing the PC's bag.

After taling to some of my classmates, many of them elected to create a object
to represent each kind of item that that can be contained in the PC's bag, I
believed that was making the problem far more complex than it needed to be and
simply created an int array which holds three items. The first index of the bag
represents the number of Revives, the second index holds the number of Potions,
and the third index holds the number of Pokeballs. Creating objects to represent
each item is completely overboard, as the effects of the items should be handled
elsewhere.

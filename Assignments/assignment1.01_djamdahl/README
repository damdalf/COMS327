This program is my attempt at procedurally generating a 2-D game map for a
text-based Pokemon themed video game. Instead of handling the generation of
both the clearing and tall grass regions separately, I instead chose to
initialize the map covered in clearings, and then generated my tall grass
regions and forests on top of these. This reduced some of the random generation
complexity, but still left the generation of the clearings random.

While much of the map's design was left up to us students, there were certain 
criteria that we had to abide by, which included:

* All the code is in C.
* The map measures 80 units (horizontal) by 21 units (vertical).
	- Standard terminal is 80 x 24, which leaves us three rows for text.
* At least two paths through our map.
	- One oriented N-S, the other E-W. These paths must intersect
	somewhere in our map. Represented using pound synbols: (#####).
* A Pokemon Center and a Poke Mart.
	- Represented by one or more 'C' and 'M': (MM) or (CC)
						  (MM) or (CC)
	- May eventually represent these by square ASCII values around the
	'C' or 'M'.
	- The Pokemon Center and Poke Mart must be reachable from the path
	without having to go through tall grass.
* The map must contain at least two regions of tall grass.
	- Represented using colons: (:::::).
* The outermost cells of the map are immovable boulders, beyond one exit on
each border.
	- Represented using percent signs: (%%%%%).
	- N-S path must go between the top and bottom exits. 
	- E-W path must go between the right and left exits.
* The map must contain at least two clearings.
	- Represented using periods: (....).
* Optionally can include other terrains such as:
	- Trees:   (^^^^).
	- Flowers: (****).
	- Rocks:   (@@@@).
	- Water:   (~~~~).

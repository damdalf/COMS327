ASSIGNMENT 1.05

I have succumbed to the dark side, and have chosen to abandon my code and
begin using Professor Sheaffer's code. I will begin by having the map printed
through ncurses, instead of being printed to the terminal as it has been.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
STATUS:
- Imported ncurses library and became accustomed to it.
- Implemented the functionality of printing the map to the stdscr.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03/22/2002:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Figured the best place to start is allowing the player to move. From there,
will add entering PokeMarts and PokeCenters.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
STATUS:
- Implemented all eight-directions for player movement.
- Became accustomed with using ncurses to create new windows.
- Implemented the ability for the PC to enter PokeMarts and PokeCenters.
- Implemented the ability to view a list of the trainers.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the ability to enter buildings implemented, and a better understanding
of creating windows with ncurses, it is tinme to implement trainer battles.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
STATUS:
- Implemented trainer battles instigated by the PC.
- Implemented trainer battles instigated by the NPCs.

With all of the movement and dialog based events implemented, it is time to
tackle the most difficult requires: moving from map to map and modifying the
trainer list to be scrollable.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
STATUS:
- Implemented the ability to move from map to map.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
03/25/2022:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
STATUS:
- Implemented the ability to scroll through the list of trainers.
	- However, this experiences random undefined behavior here and there.
	- Without scrolling, the list works completely fine. Furthermore,
	because of how Sheaffer created his solution for 1.04, I believe it
	is unnecessary to have a scrolling trainer list. Please see my
	README for a greater explanation.
- Fixed all bugs associated with scrolling through the list of trainers.

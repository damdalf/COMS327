For this assignment we were tasked with implementing the ability to move 
the PC ('@') around the map (ensuring that the PC never leaves the map's 
border, nor exits to a new map through any of the path exits). 
Additionally, we were tasked with generating trainers on the map, using 
a minimum number (10) of trainers to be generated per map, as well as 
implementing a switch ('numTrainers') allows for a set (integer) number 
of trainers to be randomly placed throughout the map. Unless 
'numTrainers' is less than two, we had to guarantee that at LEAST one 
hiker and one rival would be generated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
- hikers: 'h'
	* Hikers path to the PC by following a max gradient on the hiker 
	map. 
- rivals: 'r'
	* Rivals path to the PC by following a max gradient on the rival 
	map. 
- pacers: 'p'
	* Pacers start with a direction and walk until they hit some 
	terrain
	that they cannot traverse, and then they turn around and repeat. 
- wanderers: 'w'
	* Wanderers never leave the terrain type they were spawned in. 
	They have a direction and walk straight ahead to the edge of the 
	terrain, whereupon they turn in a random direction and repeat. 
- stationaries: 's'
	* Stationaries don't move. - random walkers: 'n'
	* Random walkers move like pacers, but they cross terrain type
	boundaries. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
CONSTRAINTS:
 - No character will move into a map cell occupied by 
another character. 
- No NPC will spawn in a cell occupied by another 
character. 
- No NPC will spawn in or move to an exit.
- No NPC may spawn or move into a cell wherein the movement cost for that NPC type is 
infinity. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
GUIDANCE: 
- The game is driven by a priority queue. Characters are placed 
in the queue removed according to the time of their next move. The time 
of the first move is 0. Each subsequent move time is the current time 
plus the movement cost for the terrain that the character is moving to.

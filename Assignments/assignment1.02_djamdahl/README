For this assignment, we were tasked with building off of our previous random
map generation assignment from last week, by implementing the ability to move
from map to map. While this may sound easy, there were several criteria that
had to be met for each movement.
	- The world that stored these maps must be capable of storing
	399x399 maps. 
	- Each map had to be dynamically allocated (memory) and created.
	- The exits of any map and their neighbors had to line up.
	- The borders of the world could not have exits that were generated.
	- We had to provide the functionality of six different commands that
	can be entered by the user, while also gracefully handling any other
	inputs that did not correspond to the six commands.
	- The coordinates of the maps had to be printed underneath each map
	once it was printed to the terminal.
	- The probability of the map having a PokeMart and PokeCenter must
	reduce as the player moves further away from the origin (199, 199)

ASSIGNMENT 1.06
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For this assignment we were tasked with porting our entire game into C++, and
parsing a collection fo .csv files to populate our Pokemon, Moves,
Pokemon Moves, Pokemon Species, Experience, and Type Names vectors.
This involved:

 - Renaming all of our files (other than heap.c) to .cpp files.
 - Altering our Makefile to still compile our program.
 - Changing Map, Character, NPC, and PC from structs to classes.
     * No requirements for how we handled access to class variables were given.
 - PC and NPC should inherit from Character.
 - Creating a class to represent the six .csv files we had to parse.
 - Looking for the .csv files in multiple locations.
 - Parsing the six .csv files and storing the associated data.
 - Displaying the data that we obtained.

The only noteworthy thing about my solution is how I went about handling the
file reading / parsing functionality, which is contained in 'file_reader.h'
and 'file_reader.cpp'. I went ahead and created conventionally-correct C++
classes in order to learn more about C++ and it created a very fast and
intuitive solution for meeting the requirements.

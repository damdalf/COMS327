For this assignment, we were tasked with implementing a UI that allows 
the user to move the PC around the map, using the ncurses library. 
Additionally, we had to implement the functionality of the PC being able 
to move from map to map using the path exits, whilse ensuring that a map 
remains the same as it was when the PC left and moved to a different map.

Additional functionality included:
- Displaying a list of the NPCs and their distance from the PC.
- Trainer battle dialogs triggering.
- Entering a PokeMart / PokeCenter, with associated dialog.

While I think many of my solutions, while a bit robust, are rather intuitive.
The code definitely needs some refactoring, but I didn't want to mess with
Sheaffer's code too much, as it is very difficult to comprehend. I think I came
up with a very simple and intuitive solution to implementing a scrolling
trainer list, after struggling with it for quite some time.

However, I have not implemented the '--numTrainers' switch, as Sheaffer did
not include it in his 1.04 solution, and it is not explicitly asked for
in the requirements for 1.05.

01/28/22:
	Created project directory and began looking at assignment requirements.
	Looked into several techniques used to procedurally generate a 2-D
	map for a text-based game like the one that we are creating.
01/31/22:
	Looked through examples of maps that were posted to the Piazza for ideas
	of how to go about creating mine. Began adding function stubs for methods
	that I believe will be of use.
02/01/22: 
	Created and implemented several basic methods: printColor(), generateSeed(),
	printMap(), initializeMap(), and tallGrassRegions(). However, encountering a
	bug where tallGrassRegions() does not always produce TWO regions, as the regions
	become connected. Currently do not have a 100% working solution.
02/02/22:
	Created and implemented the other neccessary methods, which include: placeExits()
	manuallyPlaceExits(), buildPaths(), placePokeMart(), placePokeCenter(), seededGeneration(),
	and randomGeneration(). Additionally, I changed the color schemes of certain map items to
	to create a more lively map. I have not resolved the issue with my tallGrassRegions() where
	TWO tall grass regions are generated every time. I made the generation of these regions
	completely random, and as a result I have yet to create a way to guarrantee that two
	SEPARATE regions are generated, as they still tend to occasionally form together. However,
	all other aspects of the map's generation are working. While there is a some refactoring
	and other changes I'd like to complete, I am getting this assignment ready for submission
	to avoid the possibility of the TA's beginning grading this assignment earlier than expected.

	As to the changes I'd like to make,there are several:
		- Resolving the above mentioned issues with tallGrassRegions().
		- General refactoring of my code.
		- Revising my path generation to appear more organic and natural.
		- The addition of small ponds.
		- More locations that the PokeMart and PokeCenter can be placed. While their locations
		are random, as of now the PokeCenter will always be placed above a segment of the paths
		and the PokeMart will always be placed below a segment of the paths.
		- Changes to certain characters used to represent the map objects.

	Resolved above issues with tallGrassRegions(), which is now generateRegions() as I added
	the generation of forests. Refactored a bit of my code, but still needs more work. Changed
	some of the characters used to display the map contents as well as the colors used. While
	there is more work I would like to do with the map generation, it meets the criteria as of
	now in its current state. Thus, I will save those changes for a later date. Additionally,
	added the function addRandom() which randomly adds flowers, rocks, and trees throughout
	the map.

	As to the changes I'd like to implement at a later date:
		- Further refactoring of my code.
		- Revising my path generation to appear more organic and natural.
		- The addition of small ponds.
		- More locations that the PokeMart and PokeCenter can be placed. While their locations
		are random, as of now the PokeCenter will always be placed above a segment of the 
		paths and the PokeMart will always be placed below a segment of the paths.
		- Changes to the characters used to represent items of the map as seen fit.

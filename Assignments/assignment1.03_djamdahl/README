For this assignment we were tasked with creating cost maps that would
display the costs for each terrain entry in our terrain map, from the
PC's location within said terrain map. Specifically, we were tasked 
with creating two different cost maps for the two different kinds of
NPCs that we have established for this Pokemon game; those being
Rivals and Hikers. These two NPCs have different movement abilities,
as Hikers are the only characters in the game that are capable of 
traveling through certain terrain, such as forests and over large
rocks, as these terrains are inaccessible for the PC and Rival NPCS.

I completed this assignment by using a singly-linked list implementation
for my priority queue, and my own personal solution of using Dijkstra's
algorithm that I based off of some pseudocode that I found on the 
internet. While I didn't do anything too advanced, I created several
different structs to allow my solution to work, and I believe my solution
ended up being very intuitive.

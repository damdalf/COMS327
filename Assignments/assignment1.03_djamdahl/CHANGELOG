	Began working on Assignment1.03, and refactored my code to be more
	modular. I seaparated my original 'map.c' code into a 'map.h' header
	file (interface) and a 'map.c' source file. Additionally, I separated
	my recent 'world.c' code into a 'world.h' header file (interface) and
	a 'world.c' source file. And lastly, I created a poke327.c file that
	implements all of this functionality into a single working 'game'
	file. Yet to actually begin working on the required functionality for
	Assignment1.03.

	Began looking into an unspecified error that resulted in losing a
	point on this assignment, "Edge of the map(-1)". Have emailed the TA
	responsible for grading my assignment for further details.

	Turns out that the docked point from my Assignment 1.02 solution was
	the result of a mistake on the TA's end. Thus, no change to my code
	was neccessary.
